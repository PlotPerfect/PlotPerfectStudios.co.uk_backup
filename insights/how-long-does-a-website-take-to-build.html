            <p>
              One of the most common questions we’re asked is how long a website actually takes to build.
              The honest answer is: it depends on the goal of the site, not just the number of pages.
            </p>

            <p>
              A rushed website might go live quickly, but a properly built website — one that ranks, converts,
              and scales — needs a clear process.
            </p>

            <h2>The short answer</h2>

            <p>
              For most professional websites, a realistic timeline is between <strong>2 and 6 weeks</strong>.
              More complex builds can take longer, especially when custom systems or integrations are involved.
            </p>

            <h2>What actually affects the timeline</h2>

            <h3>1. Scope and complexity</h3>
            <p>
              A simple brochure site with a handful of pages is very different from a site that includes booking systems,
              portals, or automation.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Static brochure site → faster</li>
              <li>Bespoke SEO-first site → moderate</li>
              <li>Web apps / dashboards → longer</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Content readiness</h3>
            <p>
              Projects move faster when content is clear early on. Waiting for copy, images, or approvals
              is one of the most common causes of delays.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Decision speed</h3>
            <p>
              Clear feedback keeps momentum. When decisions drag on, timelines stretch — even if the build work is complete.
            </p>

            <h2>A typical website timeline (realistic)</h2>

            <h3>Week 1: Discovery & structure</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Define goals and audience</li>
              <li>Map page structure and intent</li>
              <li>Plan SEO foundations</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Week 2–3: Design & layout</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Visual direction</li>
              <li>UI layout and section flow</li>
              <li>Conversion and trust placement</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Week 3–4: Build & optimisation</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Hand-coded development</li>
              <li>Performance optimisation</li>
              <li>Responsive testing</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Week 4–5: Content integration & polish</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Final copy and imagery</li>
              <li>Micro-interactions and animations</li>
              <li>SEO checks</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Week 5–6: QA & launch</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Cross-device testing</li>
              <li>Final sign-off</li>
              <li>Deployment and indexing prep</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Why “super fast” builds can be risky</h2>

            <p>
              A website built in a few days usually skips steps:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>No real SEO structure</li>
              <li>Rushed design decisions</li>
              <li>Poor performance optimisation</li>
              <li>Minimal testing</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              That often leads to rebuilds later — which costs more time and money overall.
            </p>

            <h2>Can a website be built faster?</h2>

            <p>
              Yes — but only when:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Scope is tight and agreed upfront</li>
              <li>Content is ready</li>
              <li>Feedback is quick</li>
              <li>No complex systems are involved</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Speed should be a byproduct of clarity, not a replacement for quality.
            </p>

            <h2>Final thoughts</h2>

            <p>
              A good website takes time because it’s doing more than just existing online.
              It’s representing your brand, guiding users, and supporting growth.
            </p>

            <p>
              A few extra weeks at the build stage can save months of frustration later.
            </p>
