            <p>
              Most websites fail to rank not because they look bad — but because they were built with appearance
              as the priority instead of performance and intent.
            </p>

            <p>
              A visually impressive website can still be slow, confusing for search engines, and unclear for users.
              When that happens, Google struggles to understand it, users bounce, and enquiries never happen.
            </p>

            <p>
              This is why many businesses invest in a “nice-looking” site and see no real return.
            </p>

            <h2>The biggest misconception about web design</h2>

            <p>
              A common belief is that good design equals good SEO.
            </p>

            <p>
              It doesn’t.
            </p>

            <p>
              Design is only one layer of a website. Search engines don’t rank visuals —
              they rank <strong>structure, relevance, clarity, and usefulness</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
              When a site is built purely around aesthetics, it often introduces problems like:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Bloated layouts</li>
              <li>Excessive scripts</li>
              <li>Poor content hierarchy</li>
              <li>Confusing navigation</li>
              <li>Slow load times</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              All of which work against ranking.
            </p>

            <h2>What Google actually looks for</h2>

            <p>
              Search engines don’t see a website the way humans do.
            </p>

            <p>
              They look for:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Clear page structure</li>
              <li>Logical heading hierarchy</li>
              <li>Crawlable navigation</li>
              <li>Internal linking that shows importance</li>
              <li>Fast, stable loading behaviour</li>
              <li>Content that answers a specific intent</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              If those fundamentals aren’t in place, no amount of visual polish will compensate.
            </p>

            <h2>Where “pretty” websites usually go wrong</h2>

            <h3>1. Style before structure</h3>
            <p>
              Design-led builds often start with visuals, then try to force content into them later.
              This leads to weak headings, missing context, and pages that don’t clearly target anything.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Overuse of animations and effects</h3>
            <p>
              Motion can be powerful — but when it’s added without restraint, it damages performance and usability.
            </p>

            <p>
              Google tracks real user experience. Slow, unstable pages get deprioritised.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Generic layouts with no intent</h3>
            <p>
              Many sites look nice but don’t clearly answer:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Who this is for</li>
              <li>What problem it solves</li>
              <li>What action the user should take</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              That uncertainty kills conversions.
            </p>

            <h2>Why bespoke, SEO-first builds perform better</h2>

            <p>
              A bespoke build starts with <strong>purpose</strong>, not appearance.
            </p>

            <p>
              At Plot Perfect Studios, the process works in reverse:
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li>Define the goal of each page</li>
              <li>Structure content for clarity and relevance</li>
              <li>Optimise for speed and crawlability</li>
              <li>Design around that foundation</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              This approach means:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Pages target real search intent</li>
              <li>Users understand what to do next</li>
              <li>Performance stays high</li>
              <li>SEO compounds over time</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Design still matters — but it supports function, not the other way around.
            </p>

            <h2>The real cost of prioritising looks over performance</h2>

            <p>
              A “pretty” website that doesn’t rank or convert is expensive, even if it was cheap to build.
            </p>

            <p>
              Businesses often end up paying twice:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Once for the original site</li>
              <li>Again to rebuild it properly</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Starting with a performance-first mindset avoids that cycle.
            </p>

            <h2>When design actually helps SEO</h2>

            <p>
              Design becomes powerful when it:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Improves clarity</li>
              <li>Guides attention</li>
              <li>Builds trust</li>
              <li>Supports conversion paths</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              This is where modern UI and SEO meet — not as competitors, but as collaborators.
            </p>

            <h2>Final thoughts</h2>

            <p>
              A good website should look professional.
            </p>

            <p>
              A great website should <strong>rank, convert, and scale</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
              If your current site looks fine but doesn’t bring in enquiries, the issue usually isn’t marketing —
              it’s structure.
            </p>
