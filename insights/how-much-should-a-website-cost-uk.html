            <p>
              Website pricing in the UK ranges from a few hundred pounds to tens of thousands — and the reason is simple:
              you’re not just paying for “a website”, you’re paying for a system that should bring you leads, build trust,
              and support growth.
            </p>

            <p>
              A cheap website can still look good. But if it’s slow, unclear, and not built for SEO, it becomes an expense
              rather than an investment.
            </p>

            <h2>Why website pricing varies so much</h2>

            <p>
              The price depends on:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>How custom the build is (template vs bespoke)</li>
              <li>How many pages and how unique they are</li>
              <li>Whether it includes SEO foundations</li>
              <li>Whether you need systems (booking, portals, admin tools)</li>
              <li>The quality of design, copy guidance, and structure</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Two sites can look similar visually — but be completely different under the hood.
            </p>

            <h2>Typical UK pricing bands (and what you actually get)</h2>

            <h3>£300–£800: “Starter / template”</h3>
            <p>
              This is usually:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>A template or page builder</li>
              <li>Minimal SEO</li>
              <li>Generic structure</li>
              <li>Limited customisation</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Fine for a basic online presence, but not ideal if you want strong SEO or premium trust.
            </p>

            <h3>£1,000–£3,000: “Professional brochure site”</h3>
            <p>
              This is typically where you start seeing:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Better structure and page clarity</li>
              <li>Custom sections and layout choices</li>
              <li>Performance considerations</li>
              <li>Proper on-site SEO foundations</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              For many local businesses, this band offers the best balance of quality and value.
            </p>

            <h3>£3,000–£7,500: “Premium bespoke + SEO-first”</h3>
            <p>
              This level usually includes:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Fully bespoke design and build</li>
              <li>Strong internal linking and content hierarchy</li>
              <li>Higher-end motion and UI polish (without slowing the site)</li>
              <li>SEO strategy baked into structure</li>
              <li>Conversion-led layout decisions</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              This is ideal if you want the website to actively generate leads long-term.
            </p>

            <h3>£7,500+: “Systems and custom web apps”</h3>
            <p>
              This band is for websites that include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Dashboards / portals</li>
              <li>Booking engines and admin panels</li>
              <li>Automation and integrations</li>
              <li>Ongoing feature development</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              At this point, you’re building a platform — not just a website.
            </p>

            <h2>Red flags to watch out for</h2>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>No mention of structure or SEO foundations</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Everything is “included” but nothing is defined</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Heavy page builders with slow performance</strong></li>
              <li><strong>No clear process or timeline</strong></li>
              <li><strong>No ownership / handover plan</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <h2>A better way to think about price</h2>

            <p>
              Instead of “what’s the cheapest website I can get?”, ask:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Will this website bring me enquiries?</li>
              <li>Will it rank for what I offer?</li>
              <li>Does it represent my brand properly?</li>
              <li>Can it scale without needing a rebuild?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              The right website price is the one that supports growth — not the one that feels cheapest today.
            </p>

            <h2>Final thoughts</h2>

            <p>
              You can buy a website for £500. You can also buy a website that becomes a lead generator for years.
              The difference is structure, intent, and execution.
            </p>

            <p>
              If you’re investing in your business, your website should be built like an asset.
            </p>
