            <p>
              If you’re comparing a template site to a bespoke build, the question isn’t just “which is cheaper?” —
              it’s “which one will still work when the business grows?”
            </p>

            <p>
              Templates can be a decent short-term solution for simple needs. But for most businesses that want to rank,
              convert, and scale, the long-term cost usually ends up higher — even if the initial price looks attractive.
            </p>

            <h2>What “template” really means</h2>

            <p>
              A template site usually means the structure is pre-built and you’re fitting your brand and content into it.
              That can be quick, but it also limits what you can do later without rebuilding parts of the site.
            </p>

            <p>
              You may still get a nice looking website — but underneath, the foundation often isn’t designed around your
              goals, your target keywords, or your customer journey.
            </p>

            <h2>The hidden costs that show up later</h2>

            <h3>1. Speed and performance issues</h3>
            <p>
              Templates often come with extra code, scripts, and plugins that you don’t need. That bloat adds load time,
              and load time affects both SEO and conversions.
            </p>

            <h3>2. SEO limitations</h3>
            <p>
              Many template builds don’t start with a proper page hierarchy, internal linking strategy, or content intent.
              You can add SEO later — but if the foundation is wrong, it’s like building on sand.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Plugin debt (and maintenance)</h3>
            <p>
              With many template/CMS builds, features are added via plugins. Over time you end up with a stack of updates,
              conflicts, and paid add-ons — and suddenly “cheap” becomes ongoing cost and risk.
            </p>

            <h3>4. Design that looks like everyone else</h3>
            <p>
              Templates are, by definition, reused. Even when they’re customised, many businesses end up with the same
              structure and feel — which makes it harder to stand out in a competitive market.
            </p>

            <h3>5. Rebuild pressure</h3>
            <p>
              This is the big one: businesses often pay for a template site, then a year later pay again to rebuild it
              properly once they realise it can’t scale.
            </p>

            <h2>What you get with a bespoke build</h2>

            <p>
              A bespoke build is designed around your business from the start — your services, your customers, and your goals.
              The foundation is built for performance, SEO, and conversion before we even talk about styling and animations.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Speed-first:</strong> clean code and assets that load quickly</li>
              <li><strong>SEO-first:</strong> structure built around real search intent</li>
              <li><strong>Conversion-led:</strong> pages designed around actions and clarity</li>
              <li><strong>Scalable:</strong> easy to add new pages, services, and features later</li>
              <li><strong>Unique:</strong> branded design language that feels premium</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>When a template site can be “good enough”</h2>

            <p>
              To be fair, templates can work if:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>You need a temporary website while validating an idea</li>
              <li>You don’t care about organic traffic or SEO</li>
              <li>You’re happy to rebuild later when the business grows</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              But if you’re investing in the website as a real lead generator, bespoke tends to win long term.
            </p>

            <h2>A simple way to choose</h2>

            <p>
              Ask yourself:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Do I want to rank locally or nationally?</li>
              <li>Do I want the site to convert, not just exist?</li>
              <li>Will I need new pages, services, or systems later?</li>
              <li>Would I rather invest once, or pay twice?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              If your website is meant to be part of growth — not just a digital business card — a bespoke build is usually
              the smarter investment.
            </p>

            <h2>Final thoughts</h2>

            <p>
              Templates can feel like a shortcut, but many businesses end up paying for that shortcut later.
            </p>

            <p>
              A bespoke website costs more upfront because it’s built properly — but it’s designed to rank, convert, and scale
              without needing a rebuild every time your business evolves.
            </p>
