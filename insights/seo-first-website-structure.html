            <p>
              SEO isn’t something you bolt on after a website is finished. If the structure is wrong, you can write
              endless blogs and tweak metadata for months — and still struggle to rank.
            </p>

            <p>
              The best SEO outcomes come from getting the foundation right from the start: page intent, hierarchy,
              crawlability, speed, and internal linking. That’s how you build a site that compounds over time.
            </p>

            <h2>What “SEO-first” actually means</h2>

            <p>
              SEO-first doesn’t mean keyword stuffing or writing robotic copy. It means building a website so that:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Google can easily understand each page</li>
              <li>Users quickly find what they need</li>
              <li>Content matches real search intent</li>
              <li>Performance stays fast as the site grows</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              It’s a structure that supports rankings and conversions at the same time.
            </p>

            <h2>Step 1: Start with intent, not pages</h2>

            <p>
              Most websites begin with “we need a homepage, about page, services page…” — and that’s fine. But SEO-first
              structure begins with intent: <strong>what should each page rank for?</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
              We map pages to intent like:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Service pages targeting specific services (not one generic “Services” blob)</li>
              <li>Supporting pages that answer common client questions</li>
              <li>Portfolio/case study pages that build trust and internal links</li>
              <li>Insights posts that capture informational searches and funnel people to services</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Step 2: Build a clean hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3)</h2>

            <p>
              Heading structure is still one of the simplest ways to help search engines understand a page.
              A surprising number of “pretty” sites either misuse headings or skip them altogether.
            </p>

            <p>
              Our rule is simple:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>One clear <strong>H1</strong> per page</li>
              <li>Each major section is an <strong>H2</strong></li>
              <li>Supporting points sit under <strong>H3</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              This creates a logical “map” of the page for both users and crawlers.
            </p>

            <h2>Step 3: Make navigation crawlable and logical</h2>

            <p>
              Navigation isn’t just for people — it’s one of the primary signals of structure for search engines.
            </p>

            <p>
              We keep navigation:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Simple and consistent across all pages</li>
              <li>Focused on services + work + contact</li>
              <li>Built with normal links (not hidden behind scripts)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              That ensures Google can follow the site properly and understand what matters most.
            </p>

            <h2>Step 4: Internal linking (this is where rankings compound)</h2>

            <p>
              Internal links act like a routing system for authority and relevance. If you publish content but don’t link
              it into the structure, it won’t perform as well as it could.
            </p>

            <p>
              Our internal linking approach:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Every Insights post links to <a href="../services.html">Services</a> and <a href="../contact.html">Contact</a></li>
              <li>Service pages link to relevant work/case studies</li>
              <li>Work pages link back to services (reinforces relevance)</li>
              <li>Insights posts link to each other (topic clusters)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Step 5: Speed and stability are part of SEO</h2>

            <p>
              Google uses real user experience signals. If a site feels slow or unstable, users leave. When users leave,
              rankings suffer.
            </p>

            <p>
              That’s why we build with:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Clean code (no bloat)</li>
              <li>Optimised images (WebP where possible)</li>
              <li>Minimal script load</li>
              <li>Stable layouts that don’t “jump” as content loads</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Step 6: Schema-ready sections</h2>

            <p>
              We structure pages so schema can be added cleanly: FAQ blocks, service blocks, and organisation data.
              You’ve already started this with FAQ + Service schema — which is exactly how it should be done.
            </p>

            <p>
              Schema won’t replace good structure, but it helps search engines interpret what’s already there.
            </p>

            <h2>Step 7: Build content that supports the funnel</h2>

            <p>
              Not all traffic is equal. We want the site to attract:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>People ready to buy (services)</li>
              <li>People comparing options (bespoke vs template)</li>
              <li>People researching (SEO / performance / conversion)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              That’s why the site needs both “money pages” and supporting content — and why Insights is so powerful when
              it’s connected properly.
            </p>

            <h2>Final thoughts</h2>

            <p>
              SEO-first structure is boring to talk about, but it’s what separates websites that rank from websites that
              just look nice.
            </p>

            <p>
              If you build the foundation properly — intent, hierarchy, internal linking, and performance — everything
              else becomes easier and your results improve over time.
            </p>
