            <p>
              For many businesses, launching a website feels like crossing the finish line.
              In reality, it’s the starting point.
            </p>

            <p>
              A new website needs time, data, and iteration before it reaches its full potential —
              especially if SEO and conversions matter.
            </p>

            <h2>Week 1: Indexing and stabilisation</h2>

            <p>
              Immediately after launch, search engines begin crawling and indexing the site.
              This phase is about making sure everything is clean and accessible.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Pages are indexed correctly</li>
              <li>Metadata is read properly</li>
              <li>No technical errors or blocked resources</li>
              <li>Performance is stable across devices</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Small issues caught early prevent long-term problems.
            </p>

            <h2>Weeks 2–4: Data starts to appear</h2>

            <p>
              This is when initial data begins to show:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Impressions in search results</li>
              <li>User behaviour (scrolling, exits, engagement)</li>
              <li>Early enquiries or conversion patterns</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Rankings may fluctuate during this phase — that’s normal.
            </p>

            <h2>Month 2–3: SEO foundations start to compound</h2>

            <p>
              With a solid structure in place, search engines gain confidence in the site.
              This is where properly built websites begin to separate from template builds.
            </p>

            <p>
              Typical improvements include:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>More keywords appearing in search</li>
              <li>Improved visibility for service pages</li>
              <li>Better engagement metrics</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Iteration beats “set and forget”</h2>

            <p>
              The strongest websites evolve based on real data, not assumptions.
            </p>

            <p>
              Post-launch optimisation can include:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Refining copy based on user behaviour</li>
              <li>Improving CTAs and section flow</li>
              <li>Expanding service pages</li>
              <li>Adding supporting Insight content</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Content growth fuels visibility</h2>

            <p>
              Launching with a solid foundation allows content to compound properly.
              Each new page strengthens the overall structure when linked correctly.
            </p>

            <p>
              This is where many sites fail — not because they weren’t built well,
              but because growth stops.
            </p>

            <h2>Performance and maintenance still matter</h2>

            <p>
              Even fast sites need occasional checks:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Image optimisation as content grows</li>
              <li>Script hygiene</li>
              <li>Mobile performance monitoring</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Good foundations reduce maintenance — they don’t eliminate responsibility.
            </p>

            <h2>When to expect real results</h2>

            <p>
              While every project is different, realistic expectations look like:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>1–2 months:</strong> indexing, early visibility</li>
              <li><strong>3–6 months:</strong> consistent rankings and enquiries</li>
              <li><strong>6+ months:</strong> compounding SEO and brand trust</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Websites built for speed and structure tend to progress faster.
            </p>

            <h2>Final thoughts</h2>

            <p>
              A website launch isn’t a single event — it’s the start of an asset lifecycle.
            </p>

            <p>
              Businesses that treat their website as something to refine, expand,
              and improve over time see the strongest long-term returns.
            </p>
