            <p>
              Choosing a web developer isn’t just about finding someone who can “make a website”.
              It’s about finding someone who can build a website that performs: ranks, converts, and scales.
            </p>

            <p>
              Two developers can deliver something that looks similar on the surface — but the difference in structure,
              performance, and long-term results can be huge.
            </p>

            <h2>Start with the outcome you want</h2>

            <p>
              Before you compare quotes or portfolios, be clear on what the website needs to do:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Generate enquiries consistently</li>
              <li>Rank locally (or nationally)</li>
              <li>Support paid ads and landing pages</li>
              <li>Scale into more pages, services, or systems later</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              If the goal is growth, you need more than someone who can “make it look nice”.
            </p>

            <h2>Questions to ask before hiring a developer</h2>

            <h3>1) “How will you structure the site for SEO?”</h3>
            <p>
              A good answer includes intent mapping, page hierarchy, internal linking, and technical foundations.
              A weak answer is “we’ll add keywords” or “we’ll install an SEO plugin”.
            </p>

            <h3>2) “How do you approach performance?”</h3>
            <p>
              You want to hear about clean builds, optimised images, minimal scripts, and stability (Core Web Vitals).
              If performance is treated as optional, expect problems later.
            </p>

            <h3>3) “What happens after launch?”</h3>
            <p>
              A serious developer will talk about indexing, monitoring, iteration, and growth.
              If launch is treated as the finish line, the website often stalls.
            </p>

            <h3>4) “Can I add services/pages later without a rebuild?”</h3>
            <p>
              This tells you whether the foundation is scalable. Many template builds fall apart once you add complexity.
            </p>

            <h3>5) “What do I own?”</h3>
            <p>
              Clarify ownership of:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Domain and DNS access</li>
              <li>Website files/repository</li>
              <li>Hosting accounts</li>
              <li>Analytics/Search Console access</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              You should never be “locked in” without clear reason.
            </p>

            <h3>6) “How do you handle content and copy?”</h3>
            <p>
              Great sites rely on clear messaging. If you’re expected to “send text later” with no guidance,
              the final result often ends up weak.
            </p>

            <h2>Red flags to watch for</h2>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Everything is vague:</strong> “we include SEO” with no detail</li>
              <li><strong>Over-reliance on page builders:</strong> fast now, messy later</li>
              <li><strong>No performance talk:</strong> speed becomes your problem later</li>
              <li><strong>No clear process:</strong> timelines drift and quality drops</li>
              <li><strong>Unrealistic promises:</strong> “#1 on Google in a week”</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What good answers sound like</h2>

            <p>
              You’re looking for calm, confident clarity. Not hype.
            </p>

            <p>
              Good developers can explain:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>How the site will be structured and why</li>
              <li>How performance will be protected</li>
              <li>How pages are built around intent and conversion</li>
              <li>How the site can scale as the business grows</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Portfolio matters — but ask for context</h2>

            <p>
              Don’t just look at visuals. Ask:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>What was the goal of this site?</li>
              <li>Did it improve enquiries or ranking?</li>
              <li>How was performance handled?</li>
              <li>What changed after launch?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              A strong developer will happily explain the “why” behind decisions.
            </p>

            <h2>Final thoughts</h2>

            <p>
              A website is often your most important sales asset. It’s worth choosing a developer who builds for outcomes,
              not just aesthetics.
            </p>

            <p>
              If you choose well, your website becomes a long-term growth engine.
              If you choose poorly, it becomes something you replace.
            </p>
