            <p>
              Some agencies treat performance as a trade-off: “If you want it fast, it has to be simple.”
              That’s not true.
            </p>

            <p>
              The best websites feel premium <em>and</em> load fast — because performance is designed into the build,
              not patched on later.
            </p>

            <h2>What Core Web Vitals actually measure</h2>

            <p>
              Core Web Vitals are a set of metrics Google uses to evaluate real user experience. The three main ones are:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>LCP (Largest Contentful Paint):</strong> how quickly the main content appears</li>
              <li><strong>INP (Interaction to Next Paint):</strong> how responsive the page feels to user input</li>
              <li><strong>CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift):</strong> how stable the layout is as it loads</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              These don’t just affect rankings — they affect conversions. Slow, unstable pages lose trust.
            </p>

            <h2>The myth: “Animations hurt SEO”</h2>

            <p>
              Animations aren’t the problem. The problem is heavy animation libraries, unoptimised assets, and scripts that block rendering.
            </p>

            <p>
              Motion can actually improve experience when used properly — guiding attention, creating clarity, and making the site feel high-end.
              The key is restraint and implementation.
            </p>

            <h2>How to keep design premium while staying fast</h2>

            <h3>1. Optimise the hero content</h3>
            <p>
              Your hero section usually contains your largest elements: big images, large text, and background effects.
              If this loads slowly, LCP suffers.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Use optimised images (WebP)</li>
              <li>Avoid massive full-screen videos unless absolutely necessary</li>
              <li>Keep above-the-fold scripts minimal</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Avoid “layout jump” (CLS)</h3>
            <p>
              Layout shift usually happens when images or fonts load late and push content around.
              It’s one of the quickest ways to make a site feel cheap.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Always set image dimensions</li>
              <li>Use font loading responsibly</li>
              <li>Reserve space for dynamic elements</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Use CSS for polish wherever possible</h3>
            <p>
              A lot of premium effects can be done with CSS instead of heavy JS:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Hover glows</li>
              <li>Transitions</li>
              <li>Gradient overlays</li>
              <li>Blur and glass effects (used lightly)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4. Lazy-load what’s below the fold</h3>
            <p>
              You don’t need everything to load instantly — only what the user sees immediately.
              This keeps initial load fast while still allowing rich design further down the page.
            </p>

            <h3>5. Keep JavaScript lean</h3>
            <p>
              Too much JavaScript can hurt responsiveness (INP). The goal is to use JS for interactions where it’s needed,
              not as a crutch for layout.
            </p>

            <p>
              The difference between a premium fast site and a “pretty but slow” one is usually restraint.
            </p>

            <h2>Premium design signals that don’t cost performance</h2>

            <p>
              Some of the best “high-end” signals are lightweight:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Consistent spacing and typography</li>
              <li>Clean section rhythm and hierarchy</li>
              <li>Subtle glows and gradients</li>
              <li>Micro-interactions (hover / focus)</li>
              <li>Clear CTAs and trust placement</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              None of that requires heavy scripts.
            </p>

            <h2>Final thoughts</h2>

            <p>
              Performance and design aren’t enemies. When you build with intent, you can have both:
              a site that looks premium and feels instant.
            </p>

            <p>
              If your current site is slow, it’s usually not “because design is expensive” —
              it’s because it wasn’t built with performance in mind.
            </p>
